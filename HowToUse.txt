1) Will repath the textures and image planes to desired file location and also will save the scene to that new location, new location should be normally a project directory
2) Will ignore reference files and audio files.

CleanAssetFiles script:

2) will remove all namespaces
3) will bring all the objects into a single root group, if a root grp already exists it will skip this step.
